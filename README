Mapped inundation data for Mekong, Ganges, Amazon deltas
Inundation data from Ronny Schroeder, Kyle McDonald
SSWAMPS: Global Inundation data.14-day smoothed
14-days refers to filtering for snow detection, SSWAMPS itself is daily
However, large gaps exist on daily timescales due to satellite coverage,
particularly at low latitudes.

Here, pixelwise 10-day window averaging is applied to reduce grid noise.

v1 (1999-2009) and v2 (2008-2013) are derived from different satellite products,
and use slightly different interpolation schemes.  There is some overlap, but
switching at the end of 2008 is convienient.  See pickled dictionary
inun_minremoved_v1v2.pkl This file has v1 data through the end of 2008, and v2
data 2009-.  The gap at the switch may be a few days longer due to the 10day
grouping not alinging excatly.  This data has had the min value for each pixel
removed to compensate for detection of permanent ocean or rivers in some pixels.

Data is on a global 25km EASE Grid, refered to as 'ML':
See http://nsidc.org/data/ease/ease_grid.html 

lats.npy
lons.npy
Contain lat and lon values of grid cell centers on full ML grid.
Numpy built-in binary format.  Open with np.load()

Amazon/Amazon_indicies.npy
Ganges/Ganges_indicies.npy
Mekong/Mekong_indicies.npy
Contain y, x indicies of cells within each delta

Single day sample file:
Amazon/v1/inun_Amazon_mean_10day_2009_02_17.npy
Numpy file with Amazon inundation, 10day average, of 10 days up to
and including 2009-02-17.

v1 and v2 merged data for each delta, after subtracting min for each pixel:
inun_minremoved_v1v2.pkl
(Pickled dictionary, each value is a pandas dataframe (index=times,
columns=pixels)

See plot_sample_data.py for example of identifing data location and plotting
using matplotlib Basemap
